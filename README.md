## Project Overview  
This project evaluates the potential acquisition of AirThread Connections (ATC) by American Cable Communications (ACC) using a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis**. Our objective was to assess AirThread's valuation under two scenarios:  

1. **Without Synergies** - A conservative estimate valuing AirThread at **$5,922.42 million**  
2. **With Synergies** - An optimistic estimate valuing AirThread at **$8,865.76 million**  

By taking an average of these estimates, we propose a **recommended valuation of $7,394.09 million** as a balanced acquisition price.  

## Key Analysis & Findings  

### 1. Cost of Capital Estimation  
- **CAPM Inputs:**  
  - Risk-Free Rate: **4.25%** (10-year US Treasury bonds)  
  - Market Risk Premium: **5%**  
- **Asset Beta Calculation:**  
  - Used three comparable firms after excluding outliers for more accurate risk estimation  
  - Estimated **Asset Beta (βA) = 0.74**  
- **WACC Estimation:**  
  - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) = **7.02%**  

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis  
- **Projected Free Cash Flows (FCF):** Estimated for 2008-2012  
- **Terminal Value:** Used a **2% perpetual growth rate**, aligning with inflation expectations  
- **DCF Valuation:**  
  - **Without Synergies:** $5,922.42 million  
  - **With Synergies:** $8,865.76 million  
  - **Recommended Estimate:** $7,394.09 million (balancing risk & reward)  

### 3. Synergy Analysis  
- **Net Synergy Value:** $2,943.34 million (NPV from cost savings & revenue synergies)  
- **Should ACC Pay for Synergies?** Yes, but not fully, as realization depends on successful post-merger integration.  

### 4. Sensitivity Analysis  
- Evaluated how changes in key inputs (growth rate, cost of capital, synergies) affect valuation.  
- Findings:  
  - Increasing **growth rate from 1% to 3%** raises NPV from **$5,155.70M** to **$7,070.81M**  
  - Adjusting **cost of capital between 6% - 10%** results in NPVs ranging **$7,416.19M - $3,732.27M**  
  - Synergy realization significantly impacts valuation.  

## Final Recommendation  
A **DCF-based valuation of $7,394.09 million** is proposed as a reasonable acquisition price, considering both conservative and optimistic synergy estimates. The deal’s success hinges on ACC's ability to integrate AirThread efficiently.
